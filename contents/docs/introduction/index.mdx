## About this API

Welcome to the documentation of the REST API for Inventory Management for our retail store chain. This API is designed to provide an efficient and flexible way to manage the inventory of products across multiple store locations, ensuring data integrity, availability, and accuracy in real time.

The API allows administrators and integrated systems to perform a variety of key operations on the inventory, such as managing products, categories, stock levels, pricing, and more. With this API, you can automate tasks, integrate inventory management with other business software platforms, and perform dynamic queries on inventory levels in real time.
