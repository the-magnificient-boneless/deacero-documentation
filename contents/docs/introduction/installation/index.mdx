Use `docker-compose` to install all the required containers for `dev` environment:

```bash
  docker-compose down --volumes && docker system prune -a --force --volumes && docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

Or If you are using Docker Compose v2 (built into docker), use the command prefixed with docker compose (no hyphen

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

<StepItem title="Editing the Project">
  - **MDX Files:** Documentation content is stored in `contents/docs`.

To make any changes to the project, open the files in your editor and modify them as needed.
