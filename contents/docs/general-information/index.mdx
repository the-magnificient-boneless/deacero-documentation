## REST API for Retail Store Inventory Management

This project involves creating a RESTful API to manage the inventory of a retail chain. The API will serve as a central system for handling products, categories, stock levels, and transactions across multiple store locations. By providing standardized endpoints, the API will enable seamless integration with other applications, such as point-of-sale systems, inventory tracking tools, and reporting platforms, ensuring efficient inventory management and real-time data synchronization.
