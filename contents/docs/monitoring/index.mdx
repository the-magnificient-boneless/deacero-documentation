## Winston + Prometheus Integration

This section of the documentation describes how to integrate the Winston logging library with Prometheus for monitoring and log metrics collection in your application. By using this integration, you can log application events with Winston while simultaneously tracking key metrics (e.g., log levels, request counts) in Prometheus.

The integration helps you to:

- Monitor logs and gather statistics on the frequency and types of log entries.
- Expose metrics to Prometheus for real-time analysis and alerting.
- Utilize Prometheus to create dashboards in tools like Grafana, providing visibility into both application logs and performance metrics.
- With this setup, you can gain valuable insights into application health, debug issues efficiently, and monitor log patterns alongside your system's performance.
