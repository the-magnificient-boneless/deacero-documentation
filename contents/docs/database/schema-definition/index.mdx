Dynamic schema definition in Mongoose allows creating models at runtime based on
custom configurations. This approach is particularly useful for applications needing
to handle multiple collections with varying data structures without predefining each
schema.

## Technical decisions

### Advantages

- Reusability: Supports managing multiple collections dynamically without redundant code.
- Scalability: Ideal for systems requiring flexible or customizable data structures.
- Validation Integration: Controls which data is accepted into the database.

### Considerations

- Data Consistency: Using `strict: false` or flexible schemas can lead to inconsistencies, this time is disabled.
- Performance: Creating dynamic models in every request can be costly; reusing existing models is recommended. For initial release performance is not considered.
- Field Validation: Ensuring proper validation of schema data is critical to avoid errors or vulnerabilities.

### Key Features

    1. Flexibility:
        - Schemas are built dynamically using a configuration object (schemaDefinition).
        - This enables managing multiple data structures without manually defining numerous models.
    2. Dynamic Configuration:
        - `schemaDefinition`: Defines fields and their types, such as String, Number, or Date.
        - `schemaOptions`: Configures additional options like timestamps to automatically add createdAt and updatedAt.
        - `collection`: Specifies the database collection where documents will be stored.
    3. Validation:
        - Before creating a model, each field in `schemaDefinition` is validated to ensure it includes at least a `type`.
        - This ensures data adheres to the schema's constraints.
    4. `strict` Mode Compatibility:
        - By default, Mongoose only saves fields defined in the schema.
        - Setting strict: false allows inclusion of additional properties not defined in the schema.
        - ⚠️ `strict:false` pending to implement.
    5. Model Reuse:
        - If a model for a collection is already registered, it is reused to avoid conflicts.
